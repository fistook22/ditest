___
What You Will Learn :
Flask Basics


Instructions:
Build a lesson page for the di-learning platform !

1. Create a directory called lesson1.

2. Inside the directory there should be 2 markdown files (.md) : **in-this-chapter.md** and **exercises.md**
Check out the hint below for more information on markdown file.
Check out the [markdown documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

3. The first file **in-this-chapter.md** should contain a lesson of your choice.

4. The second file **exercises.md** should contain exercises (it can be yours or it can be from the platform).

5. Make a beautiful flask website that displays the content (like the DI platform). The page needs to have two tabs, one for the lesson and one for the exercises.
